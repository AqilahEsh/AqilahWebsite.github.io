                <p>I wanted to create something that is simple and yet able to be utilized for any phone size and at any placement; upright or sideway. I created a heart shaped base and extruded it to the intended height. I made a cutout through the center with dimensions that fit my phone but also other phones around me. I fillet all the corners to make it more user friendly.</p>

                <p>After downloading the 3D design as a 3MF file and printing it out. I was satisfied with the result as the heart shape of the handphone stand was evident enough from many angles. I tested the sturdiness of the stand and it was not only able to hold my phone as it lay horizontally and vertically, but it was able to hold larger phones and a calculator too.</p>

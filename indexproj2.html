                <p>First, I created the 2D design of each piece of the box on Autodesk. To join the pieces together, I utilised the tabs and spacer method. I added some extra design elements such as the my name to be engraved and hearts on the lid to give it some weight. After downloading it as DXF file, it was lazer cut in the Epiloge Fusion lazer cuttng machine.</p>
                <p>As we were allowed to glue the edges but not the hinges, I glued the sides of the box and the drawers for extra security. The hinges were placed in as the box was assembled. The 2 drawers were assembled seperately and was slot into place afterwards, finishing up the accessory box.</p>

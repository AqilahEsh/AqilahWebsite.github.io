                <p>My first task on Autodesk Fusion 360 was to create the above design. As it was my first time using any design software, I found it easier for me to break down the design into smaller bite-sized tasks to create the final 3D structure. First, I built the dominant shapes; rectanlges, circles and arcs; in 2D in it's front view (a top-down view/ bird's eye view/ whatever that is familiar to you). Next, I had to constrict the design to create fixed lines. This helped the next step to come into fruition, which is to finally finish the sketch and extrude it upwards and create the final 3D form.</p>

                <p>Following that, the next design was done in a similar fashion. I created the 2D structure by doing the front view predominant shapes; cirlces, rectanlges, arcs and a new shape- polygans. I had to ensure to constrict most of the lines of the structure by using construction lines which helped to ensure the distance between components was right. I then proceeded to extrude it. And TADAA! The 3D design was created. :)</p>

                <p>I would also like to show the number of times it took me to create the above design. I do enjoy learning these types of skills that I was never able to dabble in before, no matter how frustratingly confusing the process is. I found this funny in hindsight, but not so much during the process.</p>

                <p>As a trail run, I had to create a nametag to be lazer cut. First, I designed the base of the heart, added my name to be engraved in a font of my liking along with a hole to attach a keychain holder. However, as I downloaded the 2D version of the design as a DXF file to be used on Corel Draw software, some elements of my design did not translate well. I then, kept the base shape and added in the engraving and keyhole on Corel Draw itself. After the keychain was lazer cut, I added a keychain holder so I could use it.</p>

				<p>There are three safety courses we have to complete before conducting any lab work. I have completed the first required course, Fab Lab Safety Program. It is cool to learn that the machines made available to students are similar to those found in a variety of workplaces. It is a great opportunity to delve into this field with such access to amazing resources.</p>

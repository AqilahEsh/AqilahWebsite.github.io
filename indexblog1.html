                <p>The first task given for coding was to create a personalised website that documents my journey through this course. The coding method I was taught is HTML. I decided to use Sublime as my notepad for coding. I took me awhile to figure out the way to code for certain elements and divisons in the website as it was an intangible concept that I found difficult to grasp instantly. However, with time and repetition (10+ times), I was able to create my homepage. From there, I applied the similar codes I learned to create more pages and tabs within the website. This allowed me to organise the contents required on my website.</p>

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <img src="csspic1.jpg" alt="csspic1.jpg" width="334px" height="214px">
                <img src="csspic2.jpg" alt="csspic2.jpg" width="334px" height="214px">
                <p>On tangent of the previous secction, I then learned CSS that controls the visual layout of the html file of the website. I coded for a pink background and to align some of the pages to be centered. Certain symbols or names of division IDs could control certain sections of the website for the CSS code to implemend. The CSS file had to be embedded into the HTML file of the website for it to all come together. </p>

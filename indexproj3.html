                <p>For the 3D printed aspect of the design I wanted to add a lamp to my previous project products so as to make it a collective set. However, as the Arduino breadboard and microcontroller were too big to be placed in the open lid compartment of my accessory box, I decided to use my handphone stand I printed as a base holder for my lamp.</p>

                <p>To make a lamp that was to be suppported by the handphone stand, I had to create a sleek and thin design.</p>
                <p>This goal was greatly aided by the LED strip that is the source of light in this project. I wanted to create some level of ambience with this lamp, so I cut out many hearts of various sizes on the fornt piece to allow light to pass through while lighting up the cutout design.</p>
                <p>I measured a space for the LED strip to sit nicely between the front and back walls of the lamp to allow as much light to be emitted from this thin design.</p>
                <p>For the placement of the Arduino breadboard and mirco-controller, as I had to return it after the project, I decided to place it behind the back wall. This helped the lamp to remain balanced on its stand while retaining the overall sleek essence of the lamp.</p>
                <p>As for the power source, having it detatchable made the ambience lamp mobile and light which allowed it to be placed at any part of a room. At the same time, the user is able to decided to turn on the lamp for any duration of time the batteries allowed.</p>

                <p>Next, I had to code for a lamp using Arduino Uno micro-controller and breadboard. I uploaded the code onto the micro-controlled and tested it out by lighting up the LED strip. After different attempts, this was the code that was able to light all 8 LED lights of the strip.</p>

                <p>After putting the pieces together, I plugged in the power source and was able to turn on the Ambience Heart Lamp. The amount of light emitted from the lamp fulfilled its goal as an ambience lamp that was sleek and mobile. Reusing previous project fixture made this lamp an additional feature to its holder and made it reusable for many future purposes.</p>
                <p>In the end, the overall cost for this project, excluding materials and parts loaned from school, was $0. It was my intention to reused either old project products or leftover materials. The plywood and superglue from my previous project was at most $30 in total, if that counts. As for the power source, wires and resistor, I used those I had from previous personal projects with friends.</p>
